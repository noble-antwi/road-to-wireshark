## Section Five (5): Where and How to Capture Packets

#### Think BEFORE You Capture!

In the module "Think Before You Capture," I learned the importance of planning before diving into packet analysis with Wireshark. First, identify who is affected by the issue, whether it's isolated or widespread, and whether it's consistent or intermittent. Determine which applications and servers are impacted and if they are local or cloud-based. Understanding the network path the traffic traverses is essential for a clean capture. By considering these factors beforehand, I can capture data more effectively and resolve issues faster.

 #### How To Capture In a Switched Environment - Local Capture vs SPAN vs TAP

In this module, I learned the following key points about capturing traffic in a switched environment:

1. **Local Capture:** Installing Wireshark directly on an endpoint can be quick and easy but may strain the device's resources, especially on busy servers.
2. **SPAN/Mirror:** This method involves configuring network devices to forward packets to a monitor port. It's crucial to avoid overloading the SPAN port by sending too much traffic.
3. **Network TAP:** A TAP is a physical device inserted into the network path, providing a reliable way to capture traffic without burdening the network devices or endpoints.

Understanding these methods helps ensure effective packet capturing in switched environments.

### Capturing at Multiple Locations

When troubleshooting network issues, especially performance problems, it's beneficial to capture traffic from multiple network points. Here are the key points I learned:

1. **Client-Side Capture:** Capturing packets from the client can reveal local network conditions, broadcast activity, and the client's interactions with multiple servers.
2. **Server-Side Capture:** Capturing packets from the server can show interactions with other backend services, such as application or database servers, which might be causing the slowdown.
3. **Dual-Side Capture:** Capturing from both client and server sides helps in identifying issues like retransmissions and packet loss, offering a clearer picture of where the problem lies.

This multi-point capture approach provides a comprehensive view of the network issue, making troubleshooting more effective.

### Using Capture Filter?

- **Capture Filter**: Allows you to collect only specific traffic based on criteria you set (e.g., TCP packets, traffic to/from a specific IP address).

- **When to Use**:
  - If you know exactly what you need and want to limit the amount of captured data.
  - Useful in busy environments to focus on relevant traffic.

- **When to Avoid**:
  - If you are unsure of the issue or need to see all network activity, as capture filters might miss important traffic (e.g., backend server conversations).
  - Specific filters might exclude useful information from other protocols (e.g., ICMP messages for troubleshooting TCP issues).

- **Best Practice**:
  - Capture all traffic initially and then use display filters to analyze data. This approach provides a more comprehensive view and aids in thorough troubleshooting.
  
 ### Capturing traffic with Wireshark : User Interface

When I start Wireshark, it shows all the available interfaces, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi. To begin capturing, I select the relevant interface and click the blue shark fin icon. To stop the capture, I click the red square icon.
![All Interfaces](images/001_interfaces.png)

I learned to enable promiscuous mode in the capture options, which allows me to capture all traffic on the network, not just my own. I also discovered the snap length setting, which lets me capture only the headers (e.g., 64 bytes) to save space and avoid capturing sensitive payloads.

 ##### Packet Capture in motion
Customizing the interface list to show only the ones I use regularly is another valuable lesson. I can manage these interfaces in the capture options by unchecking those I don't need. After configuring these settings, I can start capturing traffic by clicking "Start."
![Snaplink_Capture](images/002_Snaplinks.png)

#### Long-Term Capture Configuration with Wireshark

Setting up long-term capture in Wireshark is essential for troubleshooting intermittent issues and monitoring for cybersecurity threats. By using the capture options in the Wireshark interface, I can start capturing traffic on a selected interface and configure it to save the data to a permanent file. Instead of capturing one massive file, I learned to use a **ring buffer,** which captures several smaller files and overwrites the oldest files when the buffer is full. 
![CapturesPcaps](images/004_longTermcaptures.png)
This setup helps manage disk space efficiently and makes it easier to pinpoint when an issue occurred. I also discovered that enabling promiscuous mode allows capturing all network traffic, not just traffic to and from my machine. Additionally, using the **pcapng** format over pcap provides more metadata, which is helpful for analysis. With these configurations, I can ensure continuous monitoring and have historical data available for when problems arise or if a security incident occurs.

## How to Capture on the Command Line with Dumpcap

As I continue my studies in Wireshark, I've learned how to capture packets using Dumpcap directly from the command line. This method is particularly useful when working on busy servers or when I want a quick capture without using the full Wireshark GUI.

### Accessing Dumpcap

Dumpcap is included with Wireshark and is located in the Wireshark installation directory. To simplify access, I added the Wireshark installation directory to my system's PATH variable.

### Adding Wireshark to PATH on Windows

To add Wireshark to the PATH on Windows:

1. Open Control Panel and go to System > Advanced system settings.
2. In the Environment Variables section, find and edit the Path variable to include the Wireshark installation directory, typically `C:\Program Files\Wireshark`.

![Adding Wireshark Variable](images/005_SettingEnvifomentVariables.png)

### Using Dumpcap

First, I opened the command prompt. To list all available network interfaces, I used:

```sh
dumpcap -D

```
This command displays all the interfaces I can capture from.

![Availbale Interfaces](images/006_availableInterfaces.png)

To start capturing on a specific interface, I used:

```sh
dumpcap -i [interface_number] -w [output_file]
```
For example, to capture on interface 4, which is my Wifi Interface as seen in the above image and write the output to test.pcapng, I used:
```sh
dumpcap -i 4 -w test.pcapng
```
To stop the capture, I simply pressed Ctrl + C.

### Configuring a Ring-Buffer on the CLI

When you want to capture traffic over an extended period using `dumpcap`, setting up a ring buffer on the command line is a game-changer. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

If you ever get stuck or forget how to use `dumpcap`, just type:

```bash
dumpcap -h
```

This will show you all the options you can use. But hereâ€™s a straightforward way to set up your ring buffer:
![dampcaphelp](images/007_Dumpaph.png)
```sh
dumpcap -i 4 -w noble.pcapng -b files:10 -b filesize:100
dumpcap -i 4 -w C:\Users\noble\Desktop\PROJECTS\road-to-wireshark\pcaps\RingBuffer\noble.pcapng -b files:10 -b filesize:100
```

- `-i 4` specifies the network interface you want to use. You may need to replace `4` with the correct interface number for your setup.
- `-w noble.pcapng` names your capture file. You can choose any filename you like, not just "noble". NB: The directotry to the file is the `"C:\Users\noble\Desktop\PROJECTS\road-to-wireshark\pcaps\RingBuffer\"`
- `-b files:10` sets the number of files in your ring buffer to 10. This means you will have a rotating set of 10 files.
- `-b filesize:500` sets the size of each file to 500 KB . If you need larger or smaller files, adjust this number accordingly.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00a68853-27e5-47ec-94e1-10539251bff2

*Video Illustration Above*
Whatâ€™s great about this setup is that dumpcap will continuously capture traffic, rotating through the files. Once it reaches the maximum number of files (10 in this case), it will start overwriting the oldest files.

This approach is particularly useful if you're capturing traffic in a busy environment or on a server. It ensures you don't run out of disk space and keeps your capture going without needing manual intervention.

## SECTION SIX (6) : THE ANATOMY OF A PACKET -  HOW ENCAPSULATION WORKS

### Packets and the OSI Model

Understanding the anatomy of a packet starts with the OSI model. Think of it as a guide to how different protocols interact and how various network devices fit into the communication process.

The OSI model is a seven-layer framework used to describe network protocols and interactions:

- **Application Layer**: Where applications and end-user services operate.
- **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for data translation and encryption.
- **Session Layer**: Manages sessions and connections between applications.
- **Transport Layer**: Handles end-to-end communication and error recovery.
- **Network Layer**: Manages packet forwarding including routing through different networks.
- **Data Link Layer**: Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
- **Physical Layer**: Deals with the physical connection between devices, such as cables and hardware interfaces.
  
  ![OSIModeld](images/009_OSI_Model.png)
Source: [What Are the 7 Layers of the OSI Model?](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/what_are_the_7_layers_of_the_OSI_model_network_of_communication)

In practice, you might hear about network devices operating at specific layers, such as routers (network layer) and switches (data link layer). The OSI model helps in understanding where these devices and protocols function.

Another commonly used model is the TCP/IP model, which simplifies the OSI model into four layers:

- **Network Interface Layer**: Combines the OSIâ€™s Physical and Data Link layers.
- **Internet Layer**: Maps to the OSIâ€™s Network layer.
- **Transport Layer**: Corresponds to the OSIâ€™s Transport layer.
- **Application Layer**: Covers the OSIâ€™s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9RL5jD9cTI) to view the comparism of the two types of models


Protocols operate at different layers of these models. For instance, HTTP and FTP are application-layer protocols, while TCP and UDP are transport-layer protocols. Understanding which layer a protocol operates on is crucial for effective network analysis and troubleshooting.

The key takeaway is that these models help in structuring how data is transmitted and received across networks. By understanding and using these models, you can better grasp how different protocols and devices interact and how to troubleshoot issues effectively.

###  Ethernet - The Frame Header

Ethernet operates at the **data link layer** (layer two) of the OSI model. In Wireshark, data is captured by the packet driver before being analyzed. The structure of the Ethernet frame is crucial for understanding how data is transmitted across a network.

The Ethernet frame header consists of several key components:

**Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)**: Specifies the intended recipient at layer two.

**Source MAC Address (6 bytes)**: Identifies the sender.

**EtherType Field (2 bytes)**: Indicates the protocol encapsulated in the payload.

![EthernetFrame](images/011_EthernetFrame.png)
Source: [The Ethernet II Frame Format](https://www.firewall.cx/networking/ethernet/ethernet-ii.html)


The EtherType values have specific meanings:

- `0x0800`: Indicates that the payload contains an IPv4 packet.
- `0x0806`: Indicates an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packet.
- `0x86DD`: Indicates an IPv6 packet.

To explore this in Wireshark, you can open a capture file and look at the Ethernet frames. For example, the destination and source MAC addresses are displayed in hexadecimal format. The **EtherType** field tells you the protocol that follows Ethernet. Wireshark may not show the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) because the network interface card (NIC) often does not pass it to Wireshark. The FCS is a 4-byte checksum at the end of the frame, used for error-checking.

![EthernetCapture](images/012_frameEtherne.png)

To filter for non-IP traffic in Wireshark, use the filter `!(eth.type == 0x0800)`. This will show frames with other EtherType values, such as `0x86DD` for IPv6 or `0x0806` for ARP.

When analyzing Ethernet frames:

- **Frame**: Data at the Ethernet layer.
- **Packet**: Data at the IP layer.
- **Segment**: Data at the TCP layer.

Errors at the frame level, such as FCS errors, indicate transmission issues. These errors are detected by the checksum included in the FCS. If a bit is altered during transmission, it will result in a checksum error, indicating that the frame was corrupted.

### Key Takeaways

- Ethernet frames contain destination and source MAC addresses, an EtherType field, and an optional FCS.
- EtherType values help identify the encapsulated protocol.
- Use Wireshark filters to identify non-IP traffic.
- FCS checksums help detect transmission errors, contributing to reliable data communication.

### Unicasts vs Broadcasts vs Multicasts

In my exploration of Ethernet, I delved into the concepts of unicast, broadcast, and multicast communications. Understanding these types is crucial for network packet analysis.

#### Unicast
Unicast communication occurs between a single source and a single destination. Each endpoint has a unique MAC address, and the communication is confined to these two devices. I won't be able to capture this traffic with Wireshark unless using a span, mirror, or tap, because switches only forward unicast packets to the designated interfaces.

#### Broadcast
Broadcast messages are sent to all devices in a network. In Wireshark, I can identify broadcast packets by looking at the destination MAC address, which is all "f's" (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`). When a switch receives a broadcast, it sends the packet to all interfaces within the same VLAN. Every device in the VLAN receives the broadcast and decides whether to respond.

#### Multicast
Multicast communication is more selective, targeting multiple specific devices rather than all devices. Multicast packets are sent to a group of devices that are configured to listen for a specific multicast address. This is a "one-to-many" communication model. For instance, IPv6 multicast packets are only processed by devices listening for that specific multicast MAC address.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication, only between two specific devices.
- **Broadcast**: One-to-everyone communication within the same VLAN, using a destination MAC address of all "f's".
- **Multicast**: One-to-many communication, targeting devices configured to listen for a specific multicast address.

Understanding these distinctions helps in analyzing network traffic and diagnosing network issues effectively.


### The Internet Protocol - Learning the Header Values

Moving up the OSI model to the network layer, I delved into the IPv4 header layout and its various fields. This layer primarily involves IPv4 and increasingly, IPv6.

The **IPv4 header** includes the version, header length, differentiated services (Diff Srv), total length, identification number, flags, time to live (TTL), protocol, and source and destination IP addresses.

- **Version**: Indicates IPv4 protocol.
- **Header Length**: Specifies the header size.
- **Differentiated Services (Diff Srv)**: Prioritizes certain traffic types, like VoIP.
- **Total Length**: Includes both header and payload.
- **Identification Number**: Tracks packets through the network, crucial for troubleshooting.
- **Flags**: Manage packet fragmentation.
- **Time to Live (TTL)**: Represents the number of hops a packet can take before being discarded. Each router decrements TTL, aiding in tracing the packetâ€™s path.
- **Protocol**: Specifies the type of payload: TCP (6), UDP (17), or ICMP (1), guiding Wireshark on protocol dissection.
- **Source and Destination IP Addresses**: Ensure packets reach correct endpoints, remaining unchanged unless altered by NAT, PAT, or proxies.

Understanding these fields is essential for network troubleshooting and maintaining smooth communication across the network.


###  Following a Packet Through the Network - Re-Encapsulation


Understanding IP as an end-to-end protocol versus Ethernet as a point-to-point protocol is key. Capturing at different network points shows how headers change. Hereâ€™s a simplified scenario to illustrate:
![PointToPontEndtoEnd](images/013_pointtoppintandendtoendexplanation.png)
Imagine a PC with IP 10.2 and MAC AA connected to a switch, which connects to a router (IP 10.1, MAC BB), another router (IP 11.1, MAC CC), and finally a server (IP 13.2, MAC FF).

When the PC sends a frame, it includes the source and destination IP (10.2 to 13.2). However, the Ethernet frameâ€™s MAC address targets the gateway first (BB). The router receives it, updates the frame for the next hop (CC to DD), and continues this process.

Throughout the journey, the IP packet remains the same, but the Ethernet frame is re-encapsulated at each hop. This ensures proper delivery across various network segments. If network address translation (NAT) occurs, the IP addresses may change, affecting packet analysis. 

This re-encapsulation process is crucial for understanding how data travels through a network and ensuring successful communication.

### Lab 4: Analyzing a Packet From Multiple Capture Points

In this lab assignment, I explored packet analysis from both the client and server perspectives, highlighting how ethernet and IP headers can appear differently depending on the vantage point. The key focus was on ethernet re-encapsulation.

#### Client-Side Analysis

I examined packet number two and found the following details:
Link to Packet

[Link to Client-Side  Packet](https://github.com/noble-antwi/road-to-wireshark/blob/main/pcaps/Module6_Assignment/udemy-client-slowfiledownload.pcapng)

- **Destination MAC Address:** `00:00:0c:0c:00:0e`
- **Source MAC Address:** `00:0c:29:65:3b:25`
- **IP Identification Number:** `0x7e73` (Hexadecimal), which corresponds to `32771` in decimal.
- **IP Time To Live (TTL):** `128`
- **Source IP Address:** `192.168.1.10`

#### Server-Side Analysis

Switching to the server-side capture, specifically in `udemy-server-slowfiledownload.pcapng`, I identified:

- **Corresponding Packet:** Frame Number `11`, matched using the filter `ip.id == 0x7e73`.
- **Source MAC Address:** `00:00:0c:0c:00:ff`
- **Destination MAC Address:** `00:06:5b:00:02:ff`
- **IP ID:** `32371` (Decimal, equivalent to `0x7e73` in hexadecimal)
- **IP TTL:** `127`

From this analysis, it was observed that the packet passed through **one router** and there was **no NAT (Network Address Translation)** along the path.

This exercise reinforced my understanding of how packets are encapsulated and how the same packet can be viewed differently from various points in the network.

#### Practical Insights

The continuity of the IP ID indicates no NAT or other devices that might alter the IP packet significantly. By using filters based on the IP ID, I can effectively trace the same packet across multiple captures. 

For side-by-side analysis, I learned a useful trick: On Windows, you can open two instances of Wireshark to compare captures easily. On macOS, use the terminal command:

```bash
open -n /Applications/Wireshark.app
```
